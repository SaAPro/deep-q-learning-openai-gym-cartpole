<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/SaAPro/deep-q-learning-openai-gym-cartpole/blob/master/image/demo.png" width="60%"><p>

## Introduction

This repository is an introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning to master the CartPole-v1 game from OpenAI Gym library.

This is a minimal implementation of Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Keras library is used to build the model in few lines of code.

## Requirements
Python 3 is required.

Install the requirements with

``` pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Start
Launch the script with

```python dqn.py```

You can modify easily the script to change some parameters or build a new model from scratch. Experiment different
configurations by yourself to see which one get the best results!
